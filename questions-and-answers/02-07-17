Observations:

1.) Lossy representations means that data cannot be reconstructed from the vis
2.) Axis lines can be arrange in pretty much any way
3.) Axis lines can be "line stripped" to create abstract shapes
4.) Radial coords use n/2 points for all data sets where n%2==0
5.) We recognize length more accurately than length

Questions:

1.) Are lossy representations bad? Should they be avoided?
2.) Can you "rotate" data sets to get hundreds of dimensions? 
3.) Other ways to avoid occlusion, other than color, animations, etc?
4.) 
5.)
