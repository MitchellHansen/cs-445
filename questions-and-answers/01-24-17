Observations:


1.) GLC generalized parallel and radial coords
2.) Radial and parallel are equivalent when radial is not closed
3.) Multidimensional data is often viewed via a lossy representation
4.) You can also split into 3d coords from the data
5.) The curve GLC's can be concave or convex

Questions:


1.) Any benefit / use cases of closing and not closing radial coords?
2.) What about arbitrary splitting of n dimensions? 
3.) How is the 2nd point determined on the bezier curve?
4.) 
5.)
