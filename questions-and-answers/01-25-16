Observations:

1.) When you have a module n != 0 just repeat the last coord 
2.) Arrows implicitly describe the sequence
3.) Labeling lets you restore the data from the actual visual
4.) For bezier curves, the Y level is determined essentially arbitrarily
5.) Can be mirrored on the Y axis to compare two data sets

Questions:

1.) Are there other ways to use the Y axis for this data?
2.) Does repeating the last coordinate skew data?
3.) The bezier graph, having arrows would be ambiguous, 
	they would all point down?
4.) Collocated coordinates are a lossless format to display data
5.)
