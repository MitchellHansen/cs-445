Observations:

1.) Node link diagrams can represent both trees and networks
2.) Node link has poor look up efficiency
3.) Adjacency matrix has good look up efficiency
4.) Eclosures can only be used with trees, like a quadtree
5.) Hard to trace a path through the tree

Question:

1.) Can node links be labled efficiently?
2.) How do you avoid labling occlusion with the adjacency matrix?
3.) Lookup is easy, what about labling with enclosures?
4.) What if child count was scrictly enforced with the enclosures?
5.)
