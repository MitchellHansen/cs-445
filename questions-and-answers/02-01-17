Observations:

1.) Equation of a line between two lines and then smoothly interpolating between A and B
2.) Tweening between two lines, 3 points, ABC is the implementation of bezier curves
3.) Possible to reconstruct data when using a lossless representation 
4.) Colocated and parrallel are never the silver bullet for data
5.) You must do both visual and analytical separation of data

Questions:

1.) Specific examples of data sets which use each representation?
2.) Clues to tell when a type of representation should be used?
3.) Are chernoff faces ever used outside of novelty?
4.) 
5.)
