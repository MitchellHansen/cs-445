Observations:

1.) 1D: Point, 2D: Line, 3D: Volume
2.) Expressiveness and Effectiveness are two principal guides to vis
3.) Understanding the data makes understanding the vis much easier
4.) Pop out is the act of data standing out from others
5.) Good pop-out uses contrasting colors and shapes

Questions:

1.) Can Pop out be used for data that is essentially the same?
2.) Is volume and other types of vis really that much less effective
3.) What if we're trying to compare two different data sets? Any methods for framing them? 
4.)  
5.)
