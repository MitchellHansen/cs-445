Observations:

1.) The goal of these exercises is to make out high dimensional data efficiently
2.) Linear dependency == car years or the sts launch count
3.) Hard to tell linear dependence in multi dimensional data
4.) 
5.)

Questions:

1.) Is sorted data considered linearly dependent
2.) Is a linear graph easier to discern linear dependence?
3.)
4.)
5.)
